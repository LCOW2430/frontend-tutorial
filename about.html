                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing
                        position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward
                        again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. 
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your
                        forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can. 
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up
                        position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are
                        climbing a mountain).
                    </dd>
